# Mentorship Plan: Real-Time Order Status and Trade Notifications
Hi Tigger! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview

This document outlines my approach to onboarding and mentoring a junior engineer joining the Real-Time Order Status and Trade Notifications project. As a Staff Engineer, one of my key responsibilities is to foster growth in team members while ensuring project success.

## 1. Onboarding Process

### Week 1: Project Context & Foundation

**Day 1-2: Project Introduction**
* Walk through the overall architecture diagram together
* Explain the business requirements and user needs
* Review existing trading systems and how our feature fits in
* Discuss the high-level technical approach and rationale
* Set expectations for collaboration and communication

**Day 3-4: Technical Environment Setup**
* Ensure development environment is properly configured
* Install required tooling (WebSocket clients, Kafka tools, etc.)
* Grant access to relevant repositories and documentation
* Walk through local testing environment setup
* Introduce CI/CD tools we are using it (eg: SonarQube, Bitrise, fastlan) [More details](./CI:CD.md)

**Day 5: Initial Task Assignment**
* Assign a small, well-scoped task with clear boundaries
* Example: Implement connection status indicator component
* Pair program through the first implementation
* Review their code in real-time and provide immediate feedback

### Week 2-3: Guided Implementation

* Daily standups to discuss progress and blockers
* Regular pairing sessions (at least 2x per week)
* Code reviews with detailed, constructive feedback
* Gradually increasing complexity of assigned tasks

## 2. Task Delegation Strategy

I would delegate tasks that:
1. Have clear requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Are appropriately scoped for their skill level
